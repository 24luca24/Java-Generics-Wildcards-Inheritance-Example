# Java-Generics-Wildcards-Inheritance-Example
As a student I need to do an exame for the subject Advance Java Programming.
A small piece of the program cover generics, wildcards, inheritance, and polymorphism in object-oriented programming. 
To get more in confidence with the concepts and with the kind of exercises in the exams I decided to do a small repository, where I can practice the topic.
In particular I've create a hierarchy and I resolve this exercise:

- Consider only the ArrayList implementation for the List interface. For each of the following variables (List<Shape> list, List<? extends Ellipse> list, List<? super Triangle> list), write:
    1. all (possibly raw) types of ArrayList instances that can be assign to the variable
    2. all (possibly raw) types that can be obtained from a get operation on list;
    3. all (possibly raw) types that can be added to the list with an add operation. Consider null values
